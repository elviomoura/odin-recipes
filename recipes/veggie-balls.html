    <h2>Copycat Veggie Balls</h2>
    <p>Since the Covid lockdown, I haven't been able to go to IKEA® where they serve delicious veggie balls. So in the true self-assemble spirit that makes it so famous, I set out to make a clone.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup diced white onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup cooked spinach</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added chickpeas, drained, liquid reserved</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red lentil flour</li>
        <li>½ cup chickpea flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>⅛ cup chopped fresh flat-leat parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic and onion seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable broth in a skillet over medium heat; add diced onion, carrots, and bell pepper until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally. Add corn and peas. Cook until the corn and peas are warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add water if needed to keep it from burning. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>reheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Squeeze cooked spinach to drain. Pulse chickpeas and drained spinach together in the bowl of a food processor 3 times. Add red lentil flour, chickpea flour, yeast, parsley, seasoning, sage, turmeric, and white pepper. Pulse another 3 times. Add the cooked vegetable mixture to the food processor. Pulse 5 more times. The final result should leave the chickpeas coarse and the vegetables and herbs chunky with visible pieces of bell pepper, corn kernels, and peas.</li>
        <li>Mix dough by hand to ensure all the seasoning, flours, and vegetables are fully incorporated. The dough should be sticky, not dry. Add a bit of chickpea liquid if necessary. Let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scoop out dough to make 30 balls, arranging them on the prepared baking sheet with about an inch separation.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
