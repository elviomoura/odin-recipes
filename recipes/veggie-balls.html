    <p>This peanutty, caramelly popcorn recipe tastes close to the original. It's very easy to prepare at home and makes great gifts! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>11 cups popped popcorn</li>
        <li>01 cup Spanish peanuts</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup dark corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 120 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Spread popcorn in the bottom of a large, deep roasting pan. Sprinkle peanuts over the popcorn.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, and salt together in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until sugar and butter are melted and sauce is thick and caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>pour caramel sauce over the popcorn and peanuts and stir to coat popcorn and peanuts completely, scooping any peanuts and caramel that fall to the bottom of the roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until caramel and popcorn are crisped, about 45 minutes. Turn popcorn out in a single layer on a sheet of parchament paper to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
