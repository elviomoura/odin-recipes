# odin-recipes
This is the first HTML exercise proposed by Odin Project that I do.
In this project, I used HTML elements that I've recently learned, like lists, links, images, and text tags.

Beyond that, I practiced basic git hub commands, used terminal to manage files and folds, and Visual Studio Code to edit the HTML files themselves.
